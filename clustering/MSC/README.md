<h1>What is Mean Shift Clustering</h1>
MSC is a centroid based clustering algorithm which iteratively updates centroid in the data till blobs are discovered in the sample provided. It is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm works on the concept of Kernel Density Estimation known as KDE. It is also known as mode seeking algorithm.
This algorithm is mostly used for computer vision and image segmentation.
